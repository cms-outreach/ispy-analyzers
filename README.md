# iSpy CMSSW Analyzers

This package is for production of event display files for the CMS experiment at the LHC. 

Briefly, the event display files, with a file extension `.ig` are zip archives of [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) files. A separate JSON file is made for each event. The JSON file is then easily read in the browser-based event display [iSpy WebGL](https://github.com/cms-outreach/ispy-webgl)

The `ig` files are created by running this code in a CMSSW environment, extracting out the necessary event and geometry information.

## Quick start

**Note:** You should try to match as closely as possible the version of CMSSW in which you run the iSpy analzyers to the CMSSW version used to (re)process the data. 
This example uses CMSSW_10_2_9. Substitute your own version. 

Create a CMSSW environment: 

```
cmsrel CMSSW_11_2_3
```

Change to the CMSSW_10_2_9/src/ directory:

```
cd CMSSW_11_2_3/src/
```

Initialize the CMSSW environment:

```
cmsenv
```

Clone the necessary source code:

```
git clone -b cmssw11 --single-branch https://github.com/SeungJunLee0/ispy-analyzers.git ISpy/Analyzers 
git clone https://github.com/cms-outreach/ispy-services.git ISpy/Services
```

Compile the code with the command:

```
scram b
```

Once compiled, change to ISpy/Analyzers:

```
cd ISpy/Analyzers
```

Open `python/ispy_10_X_X_cfg.py` and specify your input file here:

```
process.source = cms.Source(
    'PoolSource',
    fileNames = cms.untracked.vstring('file:///myAOD.root')
    )
```

You may be able to run the configuration `python/ispy_10_X_X_cfg.py` "out-of-the-box" on the file 
specified there:

```
process.source = cms.Source(
    'PoolSource',
    fileNames = cms.untracked.vstring(
      'root://cmsxrootd.fnal.gov//store/data/Run2018D/DoubleMuon/AOD/PromptReco-v2/000/324/998/00000/AF519538-7FE5-4A4B-BD66-6FE4900CB5C6.root'
    )
```

**NOTE** You may need to init your GRID proxy wiht the command `voms-proxy-init --rfc --voms cms`

Run the example configuration file:

```
cmsRun python/ispy_10_X_X_cfg.py
```

## Running in a container

### CMSSW Docker image

In addition to cloning the code to your local area and building and running it on lxplus you can 
do it locally in a Docker container. CMSSW Docker images are
available from the [CMSSW Docker image building service](https://cmssw-docker.web.cern.ch/).

If you don't have docker installed already, instructions are [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/).

As above, we will use CMSSW_10_2_X and with the following command fetch an image and start up a container:

```
docker run -it --name ispy  -v ~/.globus:/home/cmsusr/.globus gitlab-registry.cern.ch/cms-cloud/cmssw-docker/cmssw_10_2_21-slc7_amd64_gcc700:2020-09-22-ef834977
```

Note that the options `-it` which ensures that the container runs interactively, `--name ispy` whichs names the container for easy use later, and `-v ~/.globus:/home/cmsusr/.globus` which mounts the directory for your GRID credentials.

Once started (it may take a bit of time to download the whole image but this is only done once), you will be in a shell prompt as above:

```
[11:34:06] cmsusr@c96a44269948 ~/CMSSW_10_2_21/src $
```

Then you may follow the instructions as above.

Once you exit the container you may start it up again with the command:

```
docker start -i ispy
```

## Configuration file walk-through

This is a typical cfg file for processing AOD:

```
import FWCore.ParameterSet.Config as cms

process = cms.Process("ISPY")

process.load("Configuration.StandardSequences.MagneticField_cff")
process.load('Configuration.StandardSequences.FrontierConditions_GlobalTag_cff')
process.load("Configuration.StandardSequences.GeometryDB_cff")

from Configuration.AlCa.GlobalTag_condDBv2 import GlobalTag
process.GlobalTag = GlobalTag(process.GlobalTag, 'auto:run2_data', '')

import FWCore.Utilities.FileUtils as FileUtils
```
Here one specifies the input file
```
process.source = cms.Source('PoolSource',
                            fileNames = cms.untracked.vstring('file://pickevents_2016_AOD.root'),
)

from FWCore.MessageLogger.MessageLogger_cfi import *
```
Here is the output file name. 
```
process.add_(
    cms.Service("ISpyService",
    outputFileName = cms.untracked.string('ig_output.ig'),
    outputIg = cms.untracked.bool(True),
```
These are the number of events to write per ig file. The file name specified above is actually a pattern.
For example, given the maximum number of events below the first 10 events will be written to `ig_output_0.ig`,
the next 10 will be written to `ig_output_1.ig`, etc.
```
    outputMaxEvents = cms.untracked.int32(10), 
    debug = cms.untracked.bool(True)
    )
)

process.options = cms.untracked.PSet(
    SkipEvent = cms.untracked.vstring('ProductNotFound')
    )
```
These are the number of events to cycle through in the input root file. If `-1` then it will
go through all of them.
```
process.maxEvents = cms.untracked.PSet(
    input = cms.untracked.int32(-1)
)
```
It is often useful to explicitly load the configurations as below. 
```
# Load things explicitly here; mostly AOD stuff
process.load("ISpy.Analyzers.ISpyEvent_cfi")
process.load('ISpy.Analyzers.ISpyCSCRecHit2D_cfi')
process.load('ISpy.Analyzers.ISpyCSCSegment_cfi')
process.load('ISpy.Analyzers.ISpyDTRecHit_cfi')
process.load('ISpy.Analyzers.ISpyDTRecSegment4D_cfi')
process.load('ISpy.Analyzers.ISpyEBRecHit_cfi')
process.load('ISpy.Analyzers.ISpyEERecHit_cfi')
process.load('ISpy.Analyzers.ISpyESRecHit_cfi')
process.load('ISpy.Analyzers.ISpyHBRecHit_cfi')
process.load('ISpy.Analyzers.ISpyHERecHit_cfi')
process.load('ISpy.Analyzers.ISpyHFRecHit_cfi')
process.load('ISpy.Analyzers.ISpyHORecHit_cfi')
process.load('ISpy.Analyzers.ISpyMET_cfi')
process.load('ISpy.Analyzers.ISpyPFMET_cfi')
process.load('ISpy.Analyzers.ISpyMuon_cfi')
process.load('ISpy.Analyzers.ISpyJet_cfi')
process.load('ISpy.Analyzers.ISpyPFJet_cfi')
process.load('ISpy.Analyzers.ISpyPhoton_cfi')
process.load('ISpy.Analyzers.ISpyRPCRecHit_cfi')
process.load('ISpy.Analyzers.ISpySuperCluster_cfi')
```
Since TrackExtras are not available in AOD the `TrackExtrapolation` collection is 
used. This handles tracks and gsfElectrons
```
process.load('ISpy.Analyzers.ISpyTrackExtrapolation_cfi')
process.load('ISpy.Analyzers.ISpyTriggerEvent_cfi')
process.load('ISpy.Analyzers.ISpyVertex_cfi')

```
There are default input tag names for all of the objects. Here we specify them.
```
process.ISpyCSCRecHit2D.iSpyCSCRecHit2DTag = cms.InputTag("csc2DRecHits")
process.ISpyCSCSegment.iSpyCSCSegmentTag = cms.InputTag("cscSegments")
process.ISpyDTRecHit.iSpyDTRecHitTag = cms.InputTag('dt1DRecHits')
process.ISpyDTRecSegment4D.iSpyDTRecSegment4DTag = cms.InputTag('dt4DSegments')

process.ISpyEBRecHit.iSpyEBRecHitTag = cms.InputTag('reducedEcalRecHitsEB')
process.ISpyEERecHit.iSpyEERecHitTag = cms.InputTag('reducedEcalRecHitsEE')
process.ISpyESRecHit.iSpyESRecHitTag = cms.InputTag('reducedEcalRecHitsES')

process.ISpyHBRecHit.iSpyHBRecHitTag = cms.InputTag("reducedHcalRecHits:hbhereco")
process.ISpyHERecHit.iSpyHERecHitTag = cms.InputTag("reducedHcalRecHits:hbhereco")
process.ISpyHFRecHit.iSpyHFRecHitTag = cms.InputTag("reducedHcalRecHits:hfreco")
process.ISpyHORecHit.iSpyHORecHitTag = cms.InputTag("reducedHcalRecHits:horeco")

process.ISpyJet.iSpyJetTag = cms.InputTag("iterativeCone5CaloJets")

process.ISpyMET.iSpyMETTag = cms.InputTag("htMetIC5")
process.ISpyMuon.iSpyMuonTag = cms.InputTag("muons")
process.ISpyPFJet.iSpyPFJetTag = cms.InputTag('ak4PFJets')
process.ISpyPhoton.iSpyPhotonTag = cms.InputTag('photons')
process.ISpyRPCRecHit.iSpyRPCRecHitTag = cms.InputTag("rpcRecHits")
process.ISpyVertex.iSpyVertexTag = cms.InputTag('offlinePrimaryVertices')
```
Now we specify the path and the processes.
```
process.iSpy = cms.Path(process.ISpyEvent*
                        process.ISpyCSCRecHit2D*
                        process.ISpyCSCSegment*
                        process.ISpyDTRecHit*
                        process.ISpyDTRecSegment4D*
                        process.ISpyEBRecHit*
                        process.ISpyEERecHit*
                        process.ISpyESRecHit*
                        process.ISpyHBRecHit*
                        process.ISpyHERecHit*
                        process.ISpyHFRecHit*
                        process.ISpyHORecHit*
                        process.ISpyMuon*
                        process.ISpyPFJet*
                        process.ISpyPFMET*
                        process.ISpyPhoton*
                        process.ISpyRPCRecHit*
                        process.ISpyTrackExtrapolation*
                        process.ISpyVertex)

process.schedule = cms.Schedule(process.iSpy)
```

## Frequently asked questions

#### What data tier can I display?

`RECO` is best. `AOD` is good. `miniAOD` will work but with the caveat that tracks will not be displayed. 

#### How do I know what is in the data file?

In a CMSSW environment you can run the command `edmDumpEventContent [input file name]` which will dump the information on what objects and collections
are available in the file as well as their input tags to the screen. This is important information for your configuration file.

#### How do I know what is in the `ig` file? 

Besides loading it into the display? You can view the contents of the file in the terminal by unzipping it:

`unzip igOutput_0.ig`

which shows you something like this:

```
  inflating: Header                  
  inflating: Events/Run_324998/Event_319188370  
  inflating: Events/Run_324998/Event_319160561  
  inflating: Events/Run_324998/Event_318570049  
  inflating: Events/Run_324998/Event_318806497  
  inflating: Events/Run_324998/Event_318456746  
  inflating: Events/Run_324998/Event_318751820  
  inflating: Events/Run_324998/Event_318479879  
  inflating: Events/Run_324998/Event_318521425  
  inflating: Events/Run_324998/Event_318399858  
  inflating: Events/Run_324998/Event_318918230  
```

Each file `Event_` is a text-based JSON file which you can open in a text editor. See the information on the `ig` format below but a quick look at `Products_V1` will show you what was loaded and successfully processed. What wasn't done with so much success will show up in `Errors_V1`. This indicate objects that weren't found for example.




#### When I run `cmsRun` I get an error about missing `TrackExtras`. What gives?

It's likely you are running over `AOD` using the `ISpyTrack` analyzer. This analyzer only works when `TrackExtras` are present. Use the
`ISpyTrackExtrapolation` analyzer instead.

#### I want to select PFJets by `pt` and `eta`. How do I do that?

There are minimal selections available in the analyzers as the "philosophy" (if you can call it that) is to dump out the event and do selections on 
particular objects downstream in the display. However, given the number of reconstructed jets that can appear in the event there is some functionality for
PFJets. You can, for example, add these two lines in your cfg file:

```
process.ISpyPFJet.etMin = cms.double(30.0)
process.ISpyPFJet.etaMax = cms.double(2.5)
```

Don't forget that these are analyzers like any other and that you have the source code. Feel free to add any selections as needed.

#### I want to select Tracks by `pt`. How do I do that?

There are minimal selections available in the analyzers as the "philosophy" (if you can call it that) is to dump out the event and do selections on 
particular objects downstream in the display. However, given the number of reconstructed tracks that can appear in the event there is some functionality for
tracks. 

You can, for example, add this line to your cfg file (for `RECO`):

```
process.ISpyTrack.ptMin = cms.double(2.0)
```

or for `AOD`:

```
process.ISpyTrackExtrapolation.trackPtMin = cms.double(2.0)
```

Don't forget that these are analyzers like any other and that you have the source code. Feel free to add any selections as needed.

#### What if there is an object or collection not currently supported? 

Please open an issue.


## The ig file format

A `.ig` file is a zip archive (unzippable via unzip or similar) containing one file per event. Each event file uses a relational database-like structure, described using JSON.

ig files have a flat directory structure with a separate directory per run (run directory). Each run directory contains one or more files describing a given event (ig event file) each. The associated run number and the event number are, respectively, the file name for the run directory and for the ig event file.

The ig-event-file format is a valid JSON or python dictionary. The format defines three categories of objects: types, collections and associations-sets.

Syntax:
```
ig-event-file ::= { 'Types': type-descriptions, 'Collections': collections, 'Associations': association-sets }
```
### Types

Types are a mapping of a type-name and its associated type-description. The type-description defines the types of the objects that are to be found in the Collection which uses the same string as the type-name to be identified. The attributes (i.e. columns) of a Collection are defined by an attribute name and an attribute type. The former is just a string label, while the second one define the kind of object which is stored in the attribute, all of which have a C++ equivalent. Possible attribute types include:

<ul>
<li>simple numeric types: <em>int</em>, <em>long</em>, and <em>double</em>, which map to their C++ equivalents.</li>
<li>text-like elements: <em>string</em>, which map to <code>std::string</code>
</li>
<li>vector like quantities: <em>v2d</em>, <em>v3d</em>, <em>v4d</em> which map to <code>IgV2d</code>, <code>IgV3d</code>, <code>IgV4d</code>.</li>
</ul>

Syntax:
```
type-descriptions ::= { type-description, ... }

type-description ::= "type-name": [attributes-description, ...]

type-name ::= string-literal

attribute-description ::= ["attribute-name", "attribute-type"]

attribute-name ::= string-literal

string-literal ::= [A-Za-z_][A-Za-z_/0-9]*

attribute-type ::= int OR long OR double OR string OR v2d OR v3d OR v4d
```
### Collections

Collections are arrays of rows, identified by a collection-name. The collection-name is a string-literal which matches one of the type-names defined in types. Rows are arrays of values, where the type of the value matches the attribute-type of the attribute-description with the same position in the type-description which has its type-name matching the collection name.

This is the actual data contained in a file.

Syntax:
```
collections ::= {collection, ... }

collection ::= "type-name": [row, ...]

row ::= [ value, ...]

value ::= string-literal OR numeric-literal OR vector-literal

numeric-literal ::= [0-9]+[.][0-9]

vector-literal ::= [numeric-literal, numeric-literal, ...]
```

### Association sets

An association defines a relationship between two rows found in any (possibly the same) collections. They are uniquely identified by two couples of numbers, the first one uniquely identifying the left object of the association, the other identifying the right object. The first element of this couple of numbers is the so called collection id while the second one is called object id. The collection id is the index of the collection type within the Types table, while the object id is the index of the object within the collection. Such a couple of numbers is called object reference. An association-set is an array of associations which share some common meaning decided by the writer of the ig-file.

Syntax:

```
associations-sets ::= { association-set, ... }

association-set ::= "association-set-name": [association, ...]

association ::= [left-object, right-object]

left-object ::= object-reference

right-object ::= object-reference

object-reference ::= [collection-id, object-id]

collection-id ::= index-literal

object-id ::= index-literal

index-literal ::= [0-9]+
```

### Example

Here is a simple example of what an ig file looks like.
```

                         ["px", "double"],["py","double"],["pz", "double"]],
